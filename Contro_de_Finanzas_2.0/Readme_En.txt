## ‚ö†Ô∏è Crucial Requirement: Secure Server (HTTPS)

For the installation and offline functionality to work, the application **MUST** be hosted on a secure server. The final URL must begin with `https://`.

#### Why is this necessary?
For security reasons. Browsers only allow *Service Workers* (the technology that enables offline functionality) to register on secure connections to protect your data.

#### How to Upload the App to a Secure Server (Easy & Free Method)
The easiest way is to use a deployment service like **Netlify**.

1.  **Prepare the files**: Make sure the three files (`index.html`, `manifest.json`, `sw.js`) are together in the same folder.
2.  **Compress the folder**: Create a single `.zip` file from that folder.
3.  **Deploy to Netlify**:
    * Create a free account at [Netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com/).
    * On your main dashboard, find the site deployment section and simply **drag and drop your `.zip` file**.
4.  **Get your URL**: In less than a minute, Netlify will provide you with a unique, secure URL (e.g., `https://random-name.netlify.app`). This is the URL you will use to install your app!

4.  Confirm the name for the icon and tap **"Add"**. The app will now appear on your home screen.

### üñ•Ô∏è On Desktop (PC or Mac)

This works on modern browsers like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Brave.

2.  In the address bar, on the right side, look for a **small icon of a screen with a down arrow**.
3.  Click on that icon.
4.  A confirmation window will pop up. Click the **"Install"** button.
